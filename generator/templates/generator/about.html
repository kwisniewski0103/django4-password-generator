    <h1> ABOUT US </h1>
    <p> Hi there! My name's Kamil and I am a self-taught Python Django developer. This is one of my first Django projects,
    developed using a different online posted materials. I really enjoyed working on this project, and I truly hope that you
        will find it useful when you will need to generate your safe password. </p>
